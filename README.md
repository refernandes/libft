# Libft - @42sp

## Description
Libft is the very first project of the 42 curriculum. The goal is to create a library containing a set of general-purpose functions in C that will be used as a foundation for many of the following projects in the course. This project focuses on understanding how standard C library functions work by reimplementing them from scratch, as well as creating additional utility functions to manipulate strings, memory, and linked lists.

Building this library helped me solidify my knowledge of memory management, pointers, and the C language logic.

## Instructions

### Compilation
To compile the library, simply run `make` in the root of the repository:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the `libft.a` file.

### Makefile Targets
- `make` or `make all`: Compiles the source files and creates the library.
- `make clean`: Removes the object files (`.o`).
- `make fclean`: Removes the object files and the compiled library (`libft.a`).
- `make re`: Recompiles the entire project (fclean + all).

### Usage
To use Libft in your own projects, include the header in your C files and link the library during compilation:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Compile your project with:
```bash
cc your_file.c -L. -lft -o your_program
```

## Detailed Description
The library is divided into three main parts:

### 1. Libc Functions
Reimplementation of standard functions from `<ctype.h>`, `<string.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>`:
- **Character checks:** `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_isprint`.
- **String manipulation:** `ft_strlen`, `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strlcat`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strrchr`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_strnstr`, `ft_strdup`.
- **Memory manipulation:** `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_memcmp`.
- **Conversions:** `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`, `ft_atoi`.
- **Memory allocation:** `ft_calloc`.

### 2. Additional Functions
Functions that are not part of the standard libc but are extremely useful:
- `ft_substr`: Extracts a substring from a string.
- `ft_strjoin`: Concatenates two strings into a new one.
- `ft_strtrim`: Trims characters from the beginning and end of a string.
- `ft_split`: Splits a string into an array of strings using a delimiter.
- `ft_itoa`: Converts an integer to a string.
- `ft_strmapi` / `ft_striteri`: Applies a function to each character of a string.
- `ft_putchar_fd` / `ft_putstr_fd` / `ft_putendl_fd` / `ft_putnbr_fd`: Output functions for specific file descriptors.

### 3. Bonus Functions (Linked Lists)
A set of functions to manipulate a singly linked list structure:
- `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`, `ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`.

- [Man pages (Linux programmer's manual)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html)
- 42 School Norminette documentation.

### AI Usage
AI (Gemini) was used during this project for the following tasks:
- **Documentation:** Structuring and drafting this `README.md` to ensure it meets all the curriculum requirements while maintaining a clear and natural tone.
- **Code Optimization Hints:** Occasional consultation on edge cases for specific functions like `ft_split` and `ft_memmove` to ensure robust memory handling.
- **Makefile boilerplate:** Assisting in setting up the initial logic for the library compilation rules.
